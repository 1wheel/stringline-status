> The B division system is a LOT less reliable than the A division. The data feed is much more limited- the transponders are only at stations, and it also cannot tell the difference between local and express tracks. Unless somebody reprograms what a train is doing in the system, a local diverted to the express tracks still shows up on the displays on local tracks. An express running local does not show up on the displays, unless somebody tells the system it is local.
